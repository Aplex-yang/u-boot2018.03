Texas Instruments' K3 Remote processor driver
=============================================

In K3 generation Socs, loading an image on any processing entity
cannot be done directly from U-Boot. In order to load an image,
remoteproc driver should communicate to SYSFW with a specific sequence.
This driver calls ti_sci_proc_control apis(which communicated to TISCI
protocol dirver) in order to control the remote processor.

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible:		Shall be: "ti,am654-rproc"
- power-domains:	Should contain a phandle to a PM domain provider node
			and an args specifier containing the remote core
			device id value. This property is as per the binding,
			doc/device-tree-bindings/power/ti,sci-pm-domain.txt
- resets:		Should contain a phandle to a reset controller node
			and an args specifier containing the remote code
			device id and reset mask value. This is as per the
			doc/device-tree-bindings/reset/ti,sci-reset.txt
- proc-controls:	Should contain a phandle to a processor control node
			and an args specifier containing the remote core
			device id and host id value. This is as per the
			doc/device-tree-bindings/remoteproc/ti_sci_proc_control.txt

Optional properties:
--------------------
- assigned-clocks:	Should contain a phandle to clock node and an args
			specifier containing the remote core device id and
			the clock id within the remote core. This is as per
			doc/device-tree-bindings/clock/ti,sci-clk.txt
- assigned-clock-rates: One entry for each entry of assigned-clocks. This is
			the frequency at which the corresponding clock needs
			to be assigned.

Example:
---------

a53_0: a53@0 {
	compatible = "ti,am654-rproc";
	power-domains = <&k3_pds 0>;
	resets = <&k3_reset 0 1>;
	proc-controls = <&k3_proc_ctrl 0 1>;
};
