Texas Instruments TI SCI processor control
==========================================

Some TI SoCs contain a system controller (like the SYSFW, etc...) that is
responsible for controlling the processing entities that are present.
Communication between the host processor running an OS and the system
controller happens through a protocol known as TI SCI [1].

Processor Conrtol Node
=====================
The processor control node is used represents the physical processing entities
present on the SoC managed by the SYSFW. Because this relies on the TI SCI
protocol to communicate with the SYSFW it must be a child of the SYSFW node.

Required Properties:
--------------------
 - compatible:		Must be "ti,sci-proc-control"
 - #proc-cells: 	Must be 2.
			First is the processor id as identified by TISCI
			Second is the Host ID to which the processor control
			is transferred to.
Example (AM65x):
----------------
	sysfw: sysfw {
		compatible = "ti,am654-system-controller";
		...
		k3_proc_control: proc-control {
			compatible = "ti,sci-proc-control";
			#proc-cells = <2>;
		};
	};

Processor control Consumers
===========================
Example:
----------------
	a53_0: a53@0 {
		compatible = "ti,am654-rproc";
		...
		proc-controls = <&k3_proc_control 0 1>;
	};
